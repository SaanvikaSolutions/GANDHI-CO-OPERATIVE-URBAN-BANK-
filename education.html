            <h2><strong>Education</strong> Loan</h2>
            <p>Loans Upto <strong>Rs. 20,00,000/-</strong> under this category are typically sanctioned to fund higher education for applicants' children,
                covering expenses for postgraduate programs, professional courses, engineering, medicine, and other
                master's degrees. Applicants must provide cost estimates from the institutions where their children plan
                to study, including tuition fees, hostel charges, and other necessary supplies.
                <br>
               <strong> Interest Rates: 12% for Priority Sector and 12.5% for Non-Priority Sector.</strong>
                Monthly interest payments will be collected from the applicants or guardians until their children secure
                employment.
                The loan repayment period will be determined by the Board of Management, based on the course of study
                undertaken by the applicant's children.
