            <h2><strong>Gold</strong> Loan</h2>
            <p><strong> Up to Rs.1,00,00,000. Up to 75% of the appraised value will be granted as a loan @ 8.50% p.a.</strong>
                subject to the maximum limit of Rs.1,00,00,000. The value of the gold ornaments will be determined after
                deducting the weight of stones and other precious metals. The price per gram of gold will be set by the
                Board of Directors based on the current market value.
                Interest Rate As decided by the Board of Directors, calculated on a monthly basis.<br>
               <strong> Repayment Period: Minimum of 1 year and up to 3 years, with monthly interest payments.</strong><br>
                The borrower may
                also repay on a monthly basis.
                If the borrower fails to repay the gold loan within one year, the ornaments will be auctioned publicly
                as decided by the Board of Management. After deducting the loan dues from the sale proceeds, any surplus
                will be credited to the borrower's suspense account and refunded upon application. In case of a deficit,
                the bank has the authority to recover the amount by other means, including attaching the borrower's
                immovable properties.

                <strong>Loan @ 8.50% per annum (0.70 Paise) effective from 17-10-2023.</strong>
