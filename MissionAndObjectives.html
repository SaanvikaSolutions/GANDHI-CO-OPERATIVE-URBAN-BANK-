        <h1>Mission And objectives</h1>
        <p>The Gandhi Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd., strictly follows all 7 core principles adopted by the International
            Co-operative Alliance in 1995 to serve the members.</p>

        <div class="side-auto">
            <h3>1. Voluntary and Open Membership:</h3>
            <p>Cooperatives are voluntary organizations, open to all people able to use its services and willing to
                accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political, or religious
                discrimination.</p>

            <h3>2. Democratic Member Control:</h3>
            <p>Cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members who buy the goods or use the
                services of the cooperative and actively participate in setting policies and making decisions.</p>

            <h3>3. Members' Economic Participation:</h3>
            <p>Members contribute equally to, and democratically control, the capital of the cooperative. This benefits
                members in proportion to the business they conduct with the cooperative rather than on the capital
                invested.</p>

            <h3>4. Autonomy and Independence:</h3>
            <p>Cooperatives are autonomous, self-help organizations controlled by their members. If the co-op enters
                into agreements with other organizations or raises capital from external sources, it is done so based on
                terms that ensure democratic control by the members and maintain the cooperative's autonomy.</p>

            <h3>5. Education, Training and Information:</h3>
            <p>Cooperatives provide education and training for members, elected representatives, managers, and employees
                so they can contribute effectively to the development of their cooperative. Members also inform the
                general public about the nature and benefits of cooperatives.</p>

            <h3>6. Cooperation among Cooperatives:</h3>
            <p>Cooperatives serve their members most effectively and strengthen the cooperative movement by working
                together through local, national, regional, and international structures.</p>

            <h3>7. Concern for Community:</h3>
            <p>While focusing on member needs, cooperatives work for the sustainable development of communities through
                policies and programs accepted by the members.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The Bank provides services to its members and thus enables them to attain increased income and savings,
            investments, productivity, and purchasing power and promotes among them equitable distribution of net
            surplus through maximum utilization of economies of scale, cost-sharing, and risk-sharing without, however,
            conducting the affairs of the cooperative for eleemosynary or charitable purposes.</p>

        <p>As a cooperator, the Bank shall provide maximum economic benefits to its members, teach them efficient ways
            of doing things in a cooperative manner, and propagate cooperative practices and new ideas in business and
            management and allow the lower-income groups to increase their ownership in the wealth of this nation.</p>

        <p>"Banking" means the accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the
            public, repayable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawal by cheque, draft, order, or otherwise.</p>

        <p>As a Banker, the Gandhi Co-operative Urban Bank Ltd. fulfills all the objectives specified by the above
            definition, accepting all types of deposits from the public and lending to the lower-income groups and
            following all regulations issued by the Reserve Bank of India (the Central Bank of India) from time to time
            and helps the public in their economic growth <strong>(Chief Executive Officer)</strong>. </p>
